Wash and peel the potatoes. You can also leave the skin on if you prefer a more rustic-style fry.\\n\\n2. Cut the potatoes into long, even strips, about 1/4-inch to 1/2-inch thick. Try to make sure they are all roughly the same size, so they cook evenly.\\n\\n3. Soak the potato strips in a large bowl filled with cold water for at least 30 minutes, or up to a few hours. This step helps to remove excess starch and results in crispier fries.\\n\\n4. Drain the potatoes and pat them dry with paper towels or a clean kitchen towel.\\n\\n5. In a large, heavy pot or deep fryer, heat the vegetable oil to 300\\u00b0F (150\\u00b0C). Use a deep-fry thermometer to monitor the temperature.\\n\\n6. Carefully lower a small batch of the potato strips into the hot oil, using a slotted spoon or a spider strainer. Be cautious not to overcrowd the pot, as this can lower the oil temperature and result in soggy fries.\\n\\n7. Fry the potatoes for about 5 minutes, or until they are cooked through but not yet browned. Remove the fries from the oil with a slotted spoon or spider strainer, and let them drain on a paper towel-lined plate or wire rack.\\n\\n8. Repeat this process with the remaining potato strips, allowing the oil to return to 300\\u00b0F (150\\u00b0C) between each batch.\\n\\n9. Once all the fries have been fried once, increase the oil temperature to 375\\u00b0F (190\\u00b0C).\\n\\n10. Fry the potatoes in small batches again, for about 2-3 minutes or until they are golden brown and crispy. Remove from the oil and drain on fresh paper towels or a wire rack.\\n\\n11.
