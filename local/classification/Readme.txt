Dataset:
1. We are using Cuisine Data i.e. need to predict style of cooking.
2. Here we are using the cleaned/preprocessed data of Cuisine data.

Logistic Classification:
- In this notebook we are using Logistic regression as a model/classifier for classification.
1. Importing all the important libraries.
2. Importing cleaned_cusisine.csv data.
3. Cheacking shape of data, counts of classes/target feature.
4. Splitting into dependent and Independent Data.
5. Splitting into traning and testing data.
6. Creating Model/classifier.
7. Evaluation

Other Classification Models:
- In this notebook we are using different classification models as a model/classifier for classification.
1. Importing all the important libraries.
2. Importing cleaned_cusisine.csv data.
3. Cheacking shape of data, counts of classes/target feature.
4. Splitting into dependent and Independent Data.
5. Splitting into traning and testing data.
6. Creating different Models/classifiers.
7. Evaluation.
